# KeyCoder

This fun little project was built in 1 day as part of my 100-days-of-code. This is from day #1.

## Inspiration

Listening for keydown/keypress is a common task in interactive web design, but remembering the keyCodes is really hard for me for some reason. Wes Bos built a [tool to show you the keycodes](http://keycode.info/) and I wanted to recreate it in React. Why? Well because I am trying to come up with stuff to build every day for the next 100 days.

## Built With

KeyCoder is built with React, Emotion (because I ‚ù§Ô∏è CSS in JS), Jest, React-Testing-Library (because Kent C Dodds is awesome), and Storybook (because why not?). I like to use tools that I would use on bigger projects even though it might seem like overkill, because it gives me more experience with the tools and lets me try things I might not normally try on a bigger project ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

# What I Learned

To be honest... not much with this first one. I used tools I am mostly familiar and comfortable with (Storybook a little less comfortable), but I wanted to start off with something I knew that I could finish in one day pretty easily. However, I have been contemplating making a very small React library component to allow easily allow listening for key events using a render-props pattern, so any chance to play around with key events in React gives me a little more inspiratino each time to satisfy that itch.
